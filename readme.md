# Unified Town Recruitment

This mod was commissioned by 𝑴𝒂𝒙𝒊𝒎𝒐𝑴𝒊𝒅𝒏𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕 and developed by daemon_n.

Opening the creature recruitment dialog in a town allows you to recruit the selected creature from all towns where it is available for recruitment at once.

All changes affect only the human player.
